#COMP250 - AI Proposal

For the COMP240 game. 
In the COMP240 game the falcon AI will catch fish. This will make fish more reactive to the player and the falcon.

The fish will:
* swim away from the player
* follow other fish
* get caught by a falcon
* be idle

I will develope the fish AI in Unity and base it off the behaviour tree the falcon uses.
